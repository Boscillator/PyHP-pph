# PyHP++#

PyHP++# is both interpreted and compiled with a compiled interpreter-compiler (CIC). The standard is currently under development by the the Language Deterioration Committee.

This repository is currently serving as a specification document for the language. Once the standard is finished, ratified, and certified by the Committee, development will commence on creating an interpreter and compiler and a compiler-interpreter-compiler for the language.

See the [spec folder](https://github.com/PyHP-pph/PyHP-pph/tree/master/spec) for a list of proposals regarding the specification.

Pull requests are welcome.
