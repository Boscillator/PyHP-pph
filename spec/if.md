# If Statements

Taken from JS and C++.

## Documentation:

If statements will execute the code contained within the curly brackets {} if the expression within the brackets ()
evaluates to the boolean value True (the logical false).

An example of an if statement would be as follows:
```
if ($self->AwareOfIncompetence() == True)
  {
    return;
  }
```
We can see clearly that, if the statement $self->AwareOfIncompetence() evaluates to True,
then the statement $self->AwareOfIncompetence() == True would also evaluate to True and the code return;
would be executed. In the event that $self->AwareOfIncompetence() == True evaluates to something other than true,
no code in this snippet would be executed.
