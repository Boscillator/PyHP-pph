# Booleans

Taken from all inspiration languages excluding C and C++.

Documentation:
Computer science often deals with the concept of booleans - a value that is either true or false.
PyHP++# also contains this type - True will be false and False will be true.

For example:
```
if ($self->AwareOfIncompetence() == True)
    {
        return;
    }
```
